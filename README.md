# Virtual-Memory-Allocator
Implementation of a simple memory manager and allocator in C. An implementation of a simplified version of the function malloc() that allows the allocation
of memory segments, a version of the free() function to deallocate these segments and a function defrag() that defragments the virtual memory.
